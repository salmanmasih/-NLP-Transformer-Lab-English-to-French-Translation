# ðŸ§  NLP Transformer Lab: English to French Translation

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained **MarianMT Transformer** model on a custom dataset of Englishâ€“French sentence pairs. It includes full training, evaluation, and error analysis â€” built with Hugging Face Transformers and Datasets.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Load and tokenize parallel Englishâ€“French data
- âœ… Fine-tune `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr` using ðŸ¤— Transformers
- âœ… BLEU score evaluation on test set
- âœ… Custom error analysis with category breakdowns
- âœ… Visualization of translation performance

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

The dataset used for training is a parallel corpus of Englishâ€“French sentences. You can swap in your own dataset by replacing `eng-french.csv`.

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

- **BLEU Score** using `sacrebleu`
- Custom error categories:
  - Perfect/Near Perfect
  - Minor Issues
  - Major Errors
  - Completely Wrong

Visualizations include:
- BLEU score per sentence (bar chart)
- BLEU score vs. sentence length (scatter plot)
